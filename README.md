# group-16

As a group, we wanted to address the problem of Food Waste in the US. We created an app that let's users search for recipes using the ingredients they already have on hand in order to help relieve this problem. 

The app returns up to 5 recipes that use all the ingredients that the user searched with so that no food goes to waste. We also search YouTube for the most relevant video based on the title of each recipe that is returned to the user. 

Using local storage, users can save recipes from multiple searches, making choosing the perfect recipe easy.
